# MyFirstLocalPipeline

## General Info

I created this repo to learn more about concourse pipelines and how they work. 

Concourse runs locally and runs a build everytime changes are pushed to master. 

Once a pipeline automates a series of events it speeds up development time and means that less boring and tedious work has to be done. 

Some great resources I used to learn about concourse and related subjects: 

* [Concourse Tutorial](https://concoursetutorial.com/)
* [Docker Labs](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/chapters/webapps.md#232-write-a-dockerfile)
* [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)
